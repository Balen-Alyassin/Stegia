# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# How to run the project
1. cd frontend/cobol
2. npm install
3. npm start

# cobol
Main Features of the System:

Littering Reporting:

Any citizen must be able to report the presence of litter.

Manage Reports: 

Authorities must be able to access a Web Dashboard to visualize information about the citizens' reports and activate disposal actions.

Littering Disposal: 

Authorities, when disposing of the collected littering, shall be able to add information about the nature and type of disposed litter to reports (e.g., improving the accuracy of the data reported by citizens in the first place).

Data Collection and Storage: 

Images and data collected by multiple municipalities are stored together to form a knowledge base.

Gamification:

Citizens must be rewarded for their reports and for confirming or revealing issues in others' reports.

Transparent Littering Reporting:

If authorized by a user, the app can also scan existing photos and check for any littering in the background.

Suggested Technical Requirements:

The end-user app must be implemented with a technology that allows cross-platform execution.

The architecture of the backend must be based on micro-services.

The software must be released with a Creative Commons 0 license.
